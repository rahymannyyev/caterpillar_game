# Caterpillar to Butterfly Game

This project is a Java implementation of the classic Snake game, with a twist. Instead of controlling a snake, you'll be guiding a caterpillar through a garden, collecting apples and eventually transforming into a butterfly.

The project was created for the CMPE114 (Fundamentals of Programming II) course with classmates.
